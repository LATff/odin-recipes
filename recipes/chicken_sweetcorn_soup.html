    <h4> 
        <p>Chicken and sweetcorn soup. The classic, the takeaway standard, and, I'll say it, the yardstick by which the quality of a takeaway place can be measured.</p>
        <p>However none of that matters right now, because from this moment you have the power to create this soup in your very own home. Use it wisely.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4><ul>

        <li>15ml vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>2.5cm ginger, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>15ml light soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 cobs (300g) sweetcorn kernels, tinned is preferred</li>
        <li>1.5l chicken stock
        <li>45ml cornflour</li>
        <li>2 cooked chicken breasts, shredded or cut into strips</li>
        <li>2 eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>15ml sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 spring onions, washed and finely sliced</li>
       

    <h3>Preparation</h3>

    <h4><ol>

        <li>Fry the garlic and ginger in the oil for 1 minute in a large saucepan.</li>
        <li>Add the sweetcorn and soy sauce then fry together for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the stock and let the soup bubble.</li>
        <li>Create a slurry with the cornflour by adding a bit of water with the flour in a cup.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the slurry in a thin drizzle to the soup while stirring. The soup should thicken after a short while</li>
        <li>Stir in the chicken.</li>
        <li>Just like you did with the slurry, add the whisked eggs to the soup while stirring.</li>
        <li>Finish off with a splash of sesame oil and after dividing the soup between bowls, sprinkle with spring onion. Serve immediately.</li>
